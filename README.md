Bioinformatics: Introduction to Single Cell RNA-Seq Analysis Workshop

Mar. 24, 2021, 9 a.m. - 5:00 p.m **Online learning**

Contact - UC Davis Bioinformatics Core, [training.bioinformatics@ucdavis.edu](mailto:training.bioinformatics@ucdavis.edu)

This one-day online workshop is an in-depth look at VDJ analysis with single cell RNA-Seq data generated on the 10x platform. Participants should already be familiar with single cell RNA-Seq analysis, the basics of which will not be covered in this course.

You will need a computer with a reliable connection to the internet, current versions of [R version 4.0](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) installed, and an application that allows you to ssh into a server (e.g. Bash for Windows, or Terminal for Apple).
